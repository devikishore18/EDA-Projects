    "This project is the result of a hands‚Äëon journey through a 9-hour **Data Visualization using Python** course. It demonstrates:\n",
    "- Selection of appropriate plotting techniques based on data type\n",
    "- Creation of visualizations like box plots, scatter plots, line charts, dot charts, bar graphs, and histograms\n",
    "- Application of design elements like titles, labels, colors, legends\n",
    "- Real-world data exploration through a complete project\n",
