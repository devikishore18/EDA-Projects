## 🧠 Included Projects

### 1. 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand (UCI Repository)
- **Objective**: Understand seasonal, hourly, and weather-related trends in bike rentals.
- **EDA Focus**: Time series distribution, demand by hour, weather impact, holiday/weekend effects, heatmaps, and correlation analysis.
- **Insight**: Helps optimize fleet management, staffing, and demand forecasting for bike-sharing companies.

---

### 2. 💳 Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset (UCI Repository)
- **Objective**: Explore customer behavior and risk of credit default.
- **EDA Focus**: Payment history, bill amounts, age group analysis, default distribution across education and marital status, correlation between financial variables.
- **Insight**: Supports financial institutions in credit risk modeling and customer segmentation.

---

### 3. 🏢 Corporate HR Productivity Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Objective**: Analyze employee productivity based on work hours, job role, department, and experience.
- **EDA Focus**: Productivity trends across departments, work-life balance, age distribution, and overtime analysis.
- **Insight**: Enables HR departments to enhance productivity while maintaining employee well-being.
